# Generate-ScriptDocumentation
This script will comment and document any script provided to it.

#Upcoming Features
  1. Once Access to ChatGPT 4 api is usable I will be implementing a request to generate a flowchart based on the scripts logic.
  2. Include additional optional parameters such as Company, version, and Project Name for inclusion in the comment header and Man pages. Current context limits make this a low priority. Using the 32k context version of the ChatGPT 4 API this feature should be no problem.
